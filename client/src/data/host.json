      "I know a WHOLE lot about food, body, and love. All three of these areas of my life have been extremely out of whack and unbalanced. As a sensitive and intuitive woman with a difficult childhood, food become my ally. It was my emotional support that was always there for me. Then things got really ugly and messy when it became my greatest enemy.",
      "Now over 10 years fully committed to the path of self-love and discovery my food challenges are a thing of the past. It’s amazing. It’s magical. I finally figured out what a normal relationship to food feels like. It’s everything I imagined it would be like. Liberating. Enjoyable. Uncomplicated",
      "I don’t believe in overnight success. I fell down a lot. I got back up a lot. However, I do know that there was information that would have greatly helped me get to where I wanted to be faster.",
      "That’s the reason this summit exists. To save you time and countless shame hangovers.",
      "I’ve dedicated my career to getting this information out there in a big way. In a few short years, I’ve built a media platform of empowerment that has been used over 8 million times in 184 countries and was recognized by influencers like Psychology Today and Forbes as a technology innovating mental health.",
      "Wherever you are at, I know you can and will get better. ESPECIALLY when you let the advice from the experts in this summit sink in.",
      "I’ve helped thousands and thousands of people get to a place where food is no longer controlling their lives. Where they can confidently walk down the aisle in their wedding dress regardless of the size. Or confidently make big moves in their career and relationships because they stopped letting their weight hold them back."
